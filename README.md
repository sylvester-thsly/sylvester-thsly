## 🚀 About Me

I'm on a structured learning journey to become a professional backend developer. I focus on understanding fundamentals deeply through a **theory + practice** approach, writing all code myself to truly master the concepts.

- 🎯 **Goal:** Backend Development (APIs, Databases, Server-Side Logic)
- 📚 **Currently Learning:** C# & .NET Fundamentals
- 💡 **Learning Style:** Structured syllabus → Hands-on practice → Real projects
- 🌱 **Mindset:** Learning from mistakes, debugging, and building incrementally
